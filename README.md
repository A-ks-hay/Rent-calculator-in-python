# How It Works

## The user provides:

Total rent

Amount spent on food/snacks

Total electricity units used

Charge per electricity unit

Number of persons in the room/flat

## The program then:

Computes electricity bill

Computes grand total

Divides it among the number of persons

Displays how much each person needs to pay

# Input Example
Enter your hostel/flat rent = 8000

Enter the amount of food ordered = 2200

Enter the total of electricity spend = 90

Enter the charge per unit = 8

Enter the number of persons living in room/flat = 2


# Output Example
Total electricity bill: 720

Total expense: 10920

Amount per person: 5460
